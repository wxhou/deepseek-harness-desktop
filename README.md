> **Status: developer preview.** The upstream `dsh` is still iterating rapidly with compatibility-breaking changes; this project tracks it closely.

## Features

- **One-click install** — No Node.js / pnpm / Docker needed; bundles the Harness kernel and a Node runtime with fully automatic first-run setup.
- **Self-healing updates** — Syncs to the latest release on every launch, with a silent "Update Now / Later" prompt when a newer version is found.
- **Lightweight & cross-platform** — A Tauri 2 shell with smaller installers and lower RAM; native windows on Windows / macOS / Linux with a bilingual UI.
- **Embedded web UI** — The full Harness interface runs in-window, with a sidebar for service status, port, logs, auto-start, open in browser, data folder and language.

> **Why Tauri and not Electron?** The same features run lighter: a smaller installer and lower idle RAM, with native window controls that stay snappy — important for a local agent host you may keep open all day. The embedded WebView2/WebKit (not a bundled Chromium) also shrinks the install footprint.

## Preview

![DeepSeek Harness Desktop](docs/preivew.png)

## Quick Start

1. Download the installer for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/hairyf/deepseek-harness-desktop/releases) page.
2. Install and launch the app.
3. On the first run the app installs its dependencies: if a compatible Node.js (v22.15.0+ / v23.8.0+) is already on your machine it is reused as-is; otherwise the Node.js runtime and the prebuilt Harness bundle are downloaded (a few hundred MB in total). When setup finishes, the embedded Harness UI opens at `http://127.0.0.1:3080`.

> First run requires a network connection. Everything after that runs locally. Once installed, later launches skip the setup screens and boot straight into the harness; a silent prompt appears when a newer Harness release is available.

### Requirements

- Windows 10+ (64-bit)
- macOS 10.15+
- Linux (mainstream distributions that support AppImage)
- Network on first launch

The app bundles Node.js **v22.22.0 LTS**, which satisfies the Harness requirement of **v22.15.0+ or v23.8.0+**. On first launch it first checks for a local Node.js installation: any compatible version is reused directly and the bundled runtime download is skipped.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Rust 1.77+
- pnpm 9+
- Platform build toolchain (Windows: MSVC + WebView2; macOS: Xcode CLT; Linux: WebKit2GTK)

### Run in dev mode

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hairyf/deepseek-harness-desktop.git
cd deepseek-harness-desktop
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev
```

### Build installers

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

### Regenerate icons

```bash
pnpm icons
```

- The prebuilt Harness bundle is published by [deepseek-harness-pkg](https://github.com/hairyf/deepseek-harness-pkg); see [docs/PKG-CONTRACT.md](docs/PKG-CONTRACT.md) for the release contract.
- On every launch the app fetches the latest release commit from `deepseek-harness-pkg` and re-downloads the bundle when the installed one is outdated (the local install is kept when GitHub is unreachable).
- Full architecture notes: [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Data Directory

The data directory follows the Tauri bundle identifier (`io.github.hairyf.deepseek-harness-desktop`):

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\io.github.hairyf.deepseek-harness-desktop\`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/io.github.hairyf.deepseek-harness-desktop/`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/io.github.hairyf.deepseek-harness-desktop/`

It contains:

- `runtime/` — bundled Node.js runtime
- `dependencies/dsh/` — extracted Harness bundle
- `data/dsh/` — Harness user data (`$DSH_HOME`: profiles, sessions, settings)
- `logs/` — app and dsh service logs
- `.store.dat` — desktop settings (port, auto-start, language)

## FAQ

- **Port 3080 is already in use?** Change the port in the sidebar settings and restart the service.
- **What happens during the first-time setup?** The sidebar shows the install log and the live service log.
- **Why does the app download so much on first launch?** It downloads the Node.js runtime and the prebuilt Harness bundle (a few hundred MB) once; afterwards everything runs offline.
- **Why does the app contact GitHub on every launch?** It compares the installed Harness bundle against the latest release commit and re-downloads automatically when they differ, so upstream fixes arrive without a manual reinstall. If GitHub is unreachable, the local install is kept as-is.
- **How do updates work after the first install?** Later launches skip setup, check in the background for a newer release, and show a small "Update Now / Later" prompt — updating re-downloads the bundle and restarts the service.

## Security Notes

- This project is for personal learning, research, and testing only — please do not use it commercially.
- `dsh` is an agent harness with **local code execution capability**. Run it only in a trusted, isolated environment, and never import untrusted configurations or plugins from unknown sources.
- The developers are not liable for any data loss or security issues arising from the use of this project.
